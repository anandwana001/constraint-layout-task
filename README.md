# Constraint Layout Task

## Hacktoberfest challenge

This project is a part of learning module of constraint layout from beginner level. Try improving this UI with Android basic conventions like using of resources etc and making code more warning free. You can also use Guideline, Barrier and Groups from constraint layout. I will be using more constraint layout concepts in this UI to make us more familiar with the Constraint Layout. 

You can take this as a learning opportunity under ongoing Hacktoberfest challenge. I will be adding references to begin with constraint layout.
